// These lines define a function in Rust. The main function is special:
// it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
fn main() {
    // The `!` means that youâ€™re calling a macro instead of a normal function
    // This macro in particular prints text to screen
    println!("Hello, world!");
